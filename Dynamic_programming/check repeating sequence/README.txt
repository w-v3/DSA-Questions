problem 
Given a string A, Check if the length of the longest repeating sub-sequence is greater than or equal to 2,
A longest repeating sub-sequence is defined such that,
the two subsequences have the same string character at the same position
any ith character in the two subsequences shouldnâ€™t have the same index in the original string
NOTE: If the Sub-sequence length is greater than or equal to 2 return 1, else return 0.

 
Problem Constraints
 1 <= |A| <= 100


Input Format
The first and only argument of input contains a string A.


Output Format
Return an integer, 0 or 1:

    => 0 : Length of Repeating subsequence is less than 2
    => 1 : Length of Repeating subsequence is greater than or equal to 2
 



Example Input
Input 1:
 A = "abab"
Input 2:
 A = "abba"
Input 3:
 A = "aaaaa"



Example Output
Output 1:
 1
Output 2:
 0
Output 3:
 1
 



Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 "ab" is repeated.
Explanation 2:
 There is no repeating subsequence.
Explanation 3:
 "aaaa" is repeated
